The functionality of this web application include CMS (content management system) and ERP (Enterprise resource planning).
As a customer you are able to view products, add them to the cart and buy(every customer has separate cart).
In the role of admin you can do CRUD on the products in the store and form 'orders' that contain a variety of information about this product and automatically calculate the possible quantity of the next order and you have an ability to change this number if you want to. Requests for products are formed from information about the movement (arrival and buying) of these products.
